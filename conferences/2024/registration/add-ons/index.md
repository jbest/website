## Biodiversity Bingo Night

**Join us in Okinawa for the first ever Biodiversity Bingo Night at the [Sky Bar Top Tree](https://toptree-naha.com/en/) in downtown Naha on Tuesday, September 3rd!**

Test your knowledge about organisms from Japan’s rich bio-history. Win prizes that will amaze your friends and still fit into your carry-on bag. Enjoy [delicious food and refreshing drinks](https://toptree-naha.com/food-drink/) all in the company of your friends, family and colleagues. Relax into the 7th-floor vibe of one of Okinawa’s newest social and culinary venues. We’ll have the place to ourselves between 19:00-22:00 (that’s 7-10pm). Event hosted by members of our very own SPNHC-TDWG Social Task Group.

**$40 per person. Ticket includes:**
- All the bingo you can handle.
- One drink and two food tickets (with the option to purchase more on-site)
- Round-trip bus transportation from the Ginowan City Gymnasium (in between the Okinawa Convention Center and Laguna Garden Hotel) to downtown Naha.
**NOTE**: There will be a short, but level, ~12 minute walk to/from the bus drop/pick-up location and the venue.

Only 150 seats available!! Sign up now!! Follow the instructions below.

**What is bingo?**
_In the United States and Canada, bingo is a game of chance in which each player matches the numbers printed in different arrangements on cards. The game host (known as a caller) draws balls at random, marking the selected numbers with tiles. When a player finds that the selected numbers are arranged on their card in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line, they call out "Bingo!" to alert all participants to a winning card..._ from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(American_version))

**Why Bingo at SPNHC-TDWG?**
The reason is simple. We anticipate this year's meeting in Asia will attract a large number of people for whom English is not their native tongue and so we wanted to offer a fun and social experience that does not require advanced study. Bingo is a game that almost anyone can play regardless of the languages they speak.
